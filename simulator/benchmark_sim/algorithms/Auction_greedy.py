    """
    Auction-Greedy / Silent Can-Win allocator for the simulator.

    This is the simulation version of the Pololu Auction-Greedy code.

    Agent behavior:
    - Before any clue is known, each robot follows the fixed banded serpentine
      sweep. This is the same pre-clue search pattern used by CBAA and ACBBA.
    - After any clue is locally known, the robot reevaluates its task cell whenever
      the simulator calls choose_goal(), normally once per movement/wake cycle.
    - Post-clue, it scans candidate cells and chooses one task cell using the
      "can-win" rule:
          my_bid = target_probability[cell] * REWARD_FACTOR
                   - ManhattanDistance(my_position, cell)
      A cell is acceptable only if this bid beats every predicted peer bid.
    - Peer bids are estimated from last known peer locations, not from communicated
      auction consensus or selected task cells.
    - Communication is implicit through normal simulator peer state sharing.
      This allocator does not send auction claim messages or maintain a winner
      table.
    - Because it re-scores cells from the current robot position each cycle, it
      can switch task cells when the highest-value winnable cell changes.
    - It selects a task cell only. The simulator core handles A*, movement,
      observations, belief-map updates, collision avoidance, and metrics.

    Main discrepancies from CBAA/ACBBA:
    - Uses peer-location prediction to avoid conflicts.
    - Does not use received winning bids, timestamps, bundles, or consensus
      messages.
    - Reconsiders the single best winnable cell every allocation cycle instead
      of holding a claimed task until outbid.

    What this allocator does not do:
    - It does not move the robot.
    - It does not run A*.
    - It does not update target_p directly.
    - It does not parse MQTT/UART messages.
    - It does not implement collision avoidance.

    The simulator robot shell is expected to maintain:
    - robot.pos
    - robot.heading
    - robot.target_p
    - robot.searched
    - robot.known_clues
    - robot.peer_positions
    - robot.current_goal
